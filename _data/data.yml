    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Geek. Nerd. Techie. 
      
      I have loved computers ever since I was young. I can still envision my first computer, a heavy beige, floppy driven, rectangular box stationed under the tiny desk in my room. I would spend countless hours playing games, doing homework, or simply tinkering at the command line.
     
      My love of computers continued throughout high school, where I enrolled in every programming class I could. At the University of Massachusetts, I focused on learning how business is infused with technology by earning a business degree specialized in information technology. I extended my IT skills during this time by fixing computers part time for a local retail computer chain. 
      
      Over the last 10 years I have had the pleasure of working for several great software companies, big and small, like IBM, Constant Contact, and SoftArtisans. I have helped deliver numerous IT projects spanning multiple engineering disciplines while having fun learning about different technologies along the way.
      
      I want to help build and support the next great software company.
